Danger Log

    - When the user logs in as a driver, requests a ride and then logs out. Logging in again but not as a driver would result in an error. A potential situation that should be handled.

    - Suppose we have a feature that cancels all the open rides while logging out. If they are mid-trip and they log out, it could result in a complex situation the driver remains unpaid.

    - Forgotten password is a feature that is crucial to implement.

    - Malicious inputs in the register form, such as SQL injection queries.

    - Rides should be available based on how many drivers are currently logged in and are finding rides.

    - A realistic arrival time should be provided. Else it can cause to drivers losing money over trivial reasons

    - Make sure that the website can handle more than one user logged in and using it at once

    - Handle a case where there are more than 1 ride sharers on a single ride

    - If the number of passengers on a ride will exceed the maximum capacity of a driver's car if a ride sharer joins, do not allow them to join

    - What happens if user inputs negative amount of passengers in request?

    - What happens if user inputs empty fields into our forms?

    - What happens if user preemptively presses the "enter" key on the request new ride form? We have to make sure that all fields are marked required so that
    we don't end up with a database query error when trying to edit the ride.

    - Pressing the "back" button while navigating the web app should lead to a form resubmission when the user is logged in. Else they can make malicious requests

    - A system should be implemented in order to do more background checks on the drivers. It's a very dangerous situation and the entire system of adding vehicle details
    and such should be regulated.
